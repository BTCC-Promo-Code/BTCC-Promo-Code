<h2>What Is a BTCC Promo Code?</h2>
<p>A <strong>BTCC promo code</strong> is an exclusive code provided by BTCC or its partners that allows new users to claim special rewards. By entering a promo code like <strong>BTCCBONUS</strong> during signup, you can unlock welcome perks including up to <strong>11,000 USDT in rewards</strong>, a <strong>50% discount on trading fees</strong>, and ongoing trading bonuses.</p>
<p>Promo codes are often used during promotional campaigns, giving new traders an extra incentive to join BTCC. Theyâ€™re ideal for users who want to get the most out of their first deposit and trading activity.</p>
<h2>What Is a BTCC App Referral Code?</h2>
<p>A <strong>BTCC app referral code</strong> â€” sometimes referred to as an invite code, referral link, or friend invite bonus â€” is a unique code shared by existing users. When a new user signs up using a referral code, both the inviter and the new user receive rewards.</p>
<p>The <strong>BTCC referral bonus</strong> can include cash rewards, trading rebates, and even exclusive loyalty perks. Itâ€™s an excellent way for existing users to earn by promoting the exchange and for new users to get started with a head start.</p>

<p>This code allows new users to enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to <strong>11,000 USDT</strong> in trading rewards</li>
<li><strong>50% off trading fees</strong> for a limited time</li>
<li>Access to exclusive <strong>BTCC trading rewards</strong> and events</li>
</ul>
